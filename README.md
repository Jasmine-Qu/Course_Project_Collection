## Project1-Causal-Inference
### Topic: Estimation of Demand Function for Train Travel
### Project group member: Chen Yiqiu, Chen Keyi, Guo Lu, Mi Jiale
In this project, we estimated the demand function of train travel by using data on train ticket sales at a particular train station. Treating the demand and supply equations of train travel as a system of two simultaneous equations, we adopted Two-Stage least squares (2SLS) regression as the primary analytical technique in modeling the demand function. A selfengineered instrumental variable, num_days_ahead, is particularly chosen to solve the endogeneity issue in demand analysis.

## Project2-Causal-Inference
### Topic: Estimating the Announcement Effect of the Volcker Rule
### Project group member: Chen Yiqiu, Chen Keyi, Guo Lu, Mi Jiale
In this project we estimated the announcement effect of Volcker Rule (new banking regulation in US) on US banks. More specifically, we analyzed:
(i) Did the banks decrease their trading assets after the announcement of the new regulation?
(ii) If they responded to the regulation, which banks responded most and which banks least? Why?
(iii) Remember robustness, and how should banks or regulators use these results?

## Project3-Muti-armed-Bandit
### Topic: Determining the best combination 
### Project group member: Chen Yiqiu, Chen Keyi, Guo Lu, Mi Jiale
This project is based on one simple experiment designed to encourage visitor to Obama’s selection website to sign up and donate, which was conducted by Obama’s fundraising campaign. Though this experiment, Obama’s team selected the bestperforming combination of button and media and increased click-through rate (CTR) as well as donations. Our project is a simple duplicate of this experiment with 24 different arms. Our task is to maximize the number of visitors who sign up to the website. It is essentially a multi-armed bandit model (MAB) with bandit feedback, and we try to identify the best arm by algorithms to get the highest total reward.
